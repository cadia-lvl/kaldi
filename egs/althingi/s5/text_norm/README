Before applying the FSTs from expand.grm the text should be lowercased and
simple fractions should be rewritten (f.ex. 2/3 as 2 3. DONT rewrite
fractions like 34/2010, those are taken care of by the expansion fst)
Roman numerals should also be rewritten to arabic numbers.
In the case of the AlÃ¾ingi data the xml looking features should
also be taken care of beforehand. See prep_althingi_data.sh

EXPAND_UTT.fst is the main expansion wfst. It takes care of punctuations,
abbreviations and numbers, incl. ordinals and dates. But it is build around
the abbreviation list from Althingi and rewrite conventions in the althingi
data.

ABBREVIATE.fst is used when making the language model. It is used for finding
the sentences in the text corpora that contain words that can be abbreviated,
to reduce the language model to a manageable size. It does though keep sentences
where part of the word can be rewritten even if it shouldn't, like neitt -> n1
