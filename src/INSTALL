These instructions are valid for UNIX-like systems (these steps have
been run on various Linux distributions; Darwin; Cygwin).  For native Windows
compilation, see ../windows/INSTALL.

You must first have completed the installation steps in ../tools/INSTALL
(compiling OpenFst; getting ATLAS and CLAPACK headers).

The installation instructions are

  ./configure  --openblas-root=../tools/OpenBLAS/install
  make depend
  make

Note that "make" takes a long time. You can speed it up by running make
in parallel if you have multiple CPUs, e.g. to use 8 CPUs

  make depend -j 8
  make -j 8

Note that we added the "-j 8" to run in parallel because "make" takes a long
time.  8 jobs might be too many for a laptop or small desktop machine with not
many cores.
